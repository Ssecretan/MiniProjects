# Create a string using double quotes

# Indexing: One way is to treat strings as a list and use index values
greet = 'hello'
# access 1st index element
print(greet[1]) # "e"

# Negative Indexing: Similar to a list, Python allows negative indexing for its strings.
greet = 'hello'
# access 4th last element
print(greet[-4]) # "e"

# Slicing: Access a range of characters in a string by using the slicing operator colon
greet = 'Hello'
# access character from 1st index to 3rd index
print(greet[1:4])  # "ell"

# In Python, strings are immutable (characters of a string cannot be changed)
